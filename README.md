# Home automation

## TODO Checklist

✔ Write basic python script compatible with old arduino code (only lights on/off)

✔ Write a direct-communication protocol for web browsers. (old way was to save post requests to a file using PHP)

✔ Build basic website for real-time light control

✔ Update arduino + python control programs

✔ Daily alarms

✔ React-app (an app that will hold all the functions below)

〇 Advanced alarms with support for only running on specific weekdays, and only running once
  
〇 Timers (do something after a given amount of time)
  
〇 Automation (do something when phone connects to wifi etc.)

〇 Sensors (light sensor etc.)

〇 Sunset/sunrise triggers (Visualizing the sun position at a specific time with analemmas would be cool)

〇 Build a 3D-model of the apartment with real-time control and feedback using three.js

〇 Apartment-map (2D)

〇 Docker container
